We multiply both sides by $u$ and find $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=0$, then by (1.15), $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}=0$, and by Cauchy-Riemann, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}=0$.\n$$\nf^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+i \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}=0 .\n$$\nThus $f$ is constant.\nWhy is the above only mostly a proof?

By lagrange's theorem then $p^{2 n-s}\\left|p^n m \\Longrightarrow p^{n-s}\\right| m \\Longrightarrow p \\mid m$-contradiction. So $\\phi(H)=H$, and $H$ is characteristic subgroup of $G$.\n\\end{proof}", "informal_proof": "First note that $a=a^{-1}$ is the same as saying $a^2=e$, where $e$ is the identity.

Let $y$ be a multiple root of $f(x)$. Then over a splitting field, we have\n$$\nf(x)=(x-y)^n g(x), \\text { for some integer } n \\geq 2 .\n$$\nHere $g(x)$ is a polynomial such that $g(y) \\neq 0$. Now taking derivative of $f$ we get\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=n \\cdot(x-y)^{n-1} g(x)+(x-y)^n g^{\\prime}(x)\n$$\nhere $g^{\\prime}(x)$ implies derivative of $g$ with respect to $x$. Since we have $n \\geq 2$, this implies $(n-1) \\geq 1$. Hence, (1) shows that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ has $y$ as a root. Therefore, $f(x)$ is not relatively prime to $f^{\\prime}(x)$. We now prove the other direction.\nConversely, let us assume that $f(x)$ is not relatively prime to $f^{\\prime}(x)$. Let $y$ is a root of both $f(x)$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)$. Since $y$ is a root of $f(x)$, we can write\n$$\nf(x)=(x-y) \\cdot g(x)\n$$\nfor some polynomial $g(x)$. then taking derivative of $f(x)$ we have\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=g(x)+(x-y) \\cdot g^{\\prime}(x)\n$$\nwhere $g^{\\prime}(x)$ is the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$. Since $y$ is a root of $f^{\\prime}(x)$ also we have\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(y)=0\n$$\nThen we have\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f^{\\prime}(y)=g(y)+(y-y) \\cdot g^{\\prime}(y) \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow & f^{\\prime}(y)=g(y) \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow & g(y)=0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis implies $y$ is a root of $g(x)$ also. Therefore we have\n$$\ng(x)=(x-y) \\cdot h(x)\n$$\nfor some polynomial $h(x)$. Now form (2) we have\n$$\nf(x)=(x-y)^2 \\cdot h(x) .\n$$\nThis follows that $y$ is a multiple root of $f(x)$. Therefore, $f(x)$ has a multiple root in some extension of the field $F$. This completes the proof of the Claim.\n\nIn our case, $f(x)=x^m-x$, where $m=p^n$. Now we calculate the derivative of $f$. That is\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=m x^{m-1}-1=-1(\\bmod p) .\n$$\nBy the above condition it follows that, $f^{\\prime}$ has no root same as $f$, that is, $f(x)$ and $f^{\\prime}(x)$ are relatively prime. Hence, $f(x)$ has no multiple root in $F$. Since $f(x)=x^m-x$ is a polynomial of degree $m$, it follows that $f(x)$ has $m$ distinct roots in $F$, where $m=p^n$.

I.e. the statement is that there exists at least one element of order 2 in $G$. Every element $a$ of $G$ of order at least 3 has an inverse $a^{-1}$ that is not itself -- that is, $a \\neq a^{-1}$. So the subset of all such elements has an even cardinality (/size). There's exactly one element with order 1 : the identity $e^1=e$. So $G$ contains an even number of elements -call it $2 k$-- of which an even number are elements of order 3 or above -- call that $2 n$ where $n<k$-- and exactly one element of order 1 . Hence the number of elements of order 2 is $$ 2 k-2 n-1=2(k-n)-1 $$ This cannot equal 0 as $2(k-n)$ is even and 1 is odd. Hence there's at least one element of order 2 in $G$, which concludes the proof."}

Prove that $B$ is compact.\n\\begin{proof}\n    Let us call $\\|\\cdot\\|_E$ the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. We start by claiming that there exist constants $C_1, C_2>0$ such that\n$$\nC_1\\|x\\|_E \\leq\\|x\\| \\leq C_2\\|x\\|_E, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m .\n$$\nAssuming (1) to be true, let us finish the problem. First let us show that $B$ is bounded w.r.t. $d_E$, which is how we call the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Indeed, given $x \\in B,\\|x\\|_E \\leq \\frac{1}{C_1}\\|x\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{C_1}$. Hence $B \\subset\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m: d_E(x, 0)<\\frac{1}{C_1}+1\\right\\}$, which means $B$ is bounded w.r.t $d_E$.\nNow let us show that $B$ is closed w.r.t. $d_E$. Let $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d_E$, where $x_n \\in B$. Notice that this implies that $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d(x, y)=\\|x-y\\|$, the distance coming from $\\|\\cdot\\|$, since by (1) we have\n$$\nd\\left(x_n, x\\right)=\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\| \\leq C_2\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\|_E \\rightarrow 0 .\n$$\nAlso, notice that\n$$\n\\|x\\| \\leq\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\|+\\left\\|x_n\\right\\| \\leq\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\|+1,\n$$\nhence passing to the limit we obtain that $\\|x\\| \\leq 1$, therefore $x \\in B$ and so $B$ is closed w.r.t. $d_E$. Since $B$ is closed and bounded w.r.t. $d_E$, it must be compact. Now we claim that the identity function, $i d:\\left(\\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathbb{R}^m, d\\right)$ where $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\\right)$ means we are using the distance $d_E$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^m, d\\right)$ means we are using the distance $d$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, is a homeomorphism. This follows by (1), since $i d$ is always a bijection, and it is continuous and its inverse is continuous by (1) (if $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d_E$, then $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d$ and vice-versa, by (1)). By a result we saw in class, since $B$ is compact in $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\\right)$ and $i d$ is a homeomorphism, then $i d(B)=B$ is compact w.r.t. $d$.\n\nWe are left with proving (1). Notice that it suffices to prove that $C_1 \\leq\\|x\\| \\leq$ $C_2, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ with $\\|x\\|_E=1$. Indeed, if this is true, given $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, either $\\|x\\|_E=0$ (which implies $x=0$ and (1) holds in this case), or $x /\\|x\\|_E=y$ is such that $\\|y\\|_E=1$, so $C_1 \\leq\\|y\\| \\leq C_2$, which implies $C_1\\|x\\|_E \\leq\\|x\\| \\leq C_2\\|x\\|_E$.\nWe want to show now that $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is continuous w.r.t. $d_E$, that is, given $\\varepsilon>0$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that if $d_E(x, y)<\\delta$, then $\\|\\mid x\\|-\\|y\\| \\|<\\varepsilon$.\n\nBy the triangle inequality, $\\|x\\|-\\|y\\| \\leq\\|x-y\\|$, and $\\|y\\|-\\|x\\| \\leq\\|x-y\\|$, therefore\n$$\n|\\|x||-\\| y|\\|\\leq\\| x-y \\| .\n$$\nWriting now $x=\\sum_{i=1}^m a_i e_i, y=\\sum_{i=1}^m b_i e_i$, where $e_i=(0, \\ldots, 1,0, \\ldots, 0)$ (with 1 in the i-th component), we obtain by the triangle inequality,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|x-y\\| & =\\left\\|\\sum_{i=1}^m\\left(a_i-b_i\\right) e_i\\right\\| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^m\\left|a_i-b_i\\left\\|\\left|\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| \\leq \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| \\sum_{i=1}^m\\right| a_i-b_i \\mid\\right.\\right. \\\\\n& =\\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| d_{s u m}(x, y) \\leq \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| m d_{\\max }(x, y) \\\\\n& \\leq \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| m d_E(x, y) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nLet $\\delta=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{m \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\|}$.

We need to show that if $z \\notin(a, b)$, then $z$ is not equivalent to $x$. Suppose that $z<a$. If $z$ were equivalent to $x$, then $[z, x]$ would be contained in $O$, and so we would have $z \\in A$. Hence $a$ would not be a lower bound for $A$.

The function $f(x)$ is already defined at $a_k$ and $b_k$, as well as at $a$ and $b$ (if these last two points exist). Define $g(x)$ to be $f(b)$ for $x>b$ and $f(a)$ for $x<a$ if $a$ and $b$ exist.

If $a_k<x<b_k$ and $f\\left(a_k\\right)=f\\left(b_k\\right)$, let $\\delta=\\min \\left(x-a_k, b_k-x\\right)$.
